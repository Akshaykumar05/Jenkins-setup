## Hands-on to do:
1. Create first-job with "Hello world" build it and analyse the Console output.
2. Understand to install a plugin "Simple theme" and configure it to apply. Delete an installed plugin
3. Create a user and provide role based permissions.
4. Understand use of Git plugins and Clean workspace.
------------
1. Created a job named "demo-sec" and attempled the build failure due to wrong command.
